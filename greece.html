            <p>Greece, officially the Hellenic Republic, is a country located in Southeast Europe. Its population is
                approximately 10.7 million as of 2018; Athens is its largest and capital city, followed by Thessaloniki.
                Situated on the southern tip of the Balkans, Greece is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and
                Africa. It shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north,
                and Turkey to the northeast. The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the
                west, the Cretan Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the
                Mediterranean Basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at 13,676 km (8,498 mi) in length,
                featuring many islands, of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with Mount
                Olympus being the highest peak at 2,918 metres (9,573 ft). The country consists of nine traditional
                geographic regions: Macedonia, Central Greece, the Peloponnese, Thessaly, Epirus, the Aegean Islands
                (including the Dodecanese and Cyclades), Thrace, Crete, and the Ionian Islands.</p>
