            <p>Spain is a country in Southwestern Europe with some pockets of territory in the Mediterranean Sea,
                offshore in
                the Atlantic Ocean and across the Strait of Gibraltar. Its continental European territory is situated on
                the
                Iberian Peninsula, and its insular territory includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea,
                several
                small islands in the Alboran Sea and the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The Spanish territory
                also
                includes the African semi-exclaves of Ceuta, Melilla and Peñon de Vélez across the Strait of Gibraltar.
                The
                country's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea; to the north by France,
                Andorra
                and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
