    <p>Spain is a country in Southwestern Europe with some pockets of territory in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore in
        the Atlantic Ocean and across the Strait of Gibraltar. Its continental European territory is situated on the
        Iberian Peninsula, and its insular territory includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, several
        small islands in the Alboran Sea and the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The Spanish territory also
        includes the African semi-exclaves of Ceuta, Melilla and Peñon de Vélez across the Strait of Gibraltar. The
        country's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea; to the north by France, Andorra
        and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
